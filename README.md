#### How the cooking time is being calculated ?

every dish contains a cooking duration in minutes . so we make a call to this API
`http://api.aladhan.com/v1/hijriCalendarByCity/{HijriYear}/9?city=Mecca&country=Saudi Arabia&method=2`

which returns the  prayer dates of Ramadan month for the given Hijri year therefore we use the returned data to calculate the difference between Asr prayer and Maghrib prayer in minutes and subtract the duration of the dish perpetration time to determine if you should start cooking before Asr prayer or after it and when exactly you should start


### `/suggest`

  - `day`

#### Example Request
`/suggest?day=2`
